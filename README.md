How to:

To code a web app similar to the one at the domain https://signal-react-native-6e694.web.app/ using the codebase from https://github.com/KevinRoozrokh/signal-react-native, you can follow the following step-by-step guide:

1. Set up the development environment:
   - Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) if you haven't already.
   - Choose a code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) for development.
   - Install React Native CLI globally by running the following command:
     ```
     npm install -g react-native-cli
     ```

2. Clone the codebase:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the desired directory where you want to clone the project.
   - Run the following command to clone the repository:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/KevinRoozrokh/signal-react-native.git
     ```

3. Install dependencies:
   - Navigate into the project directory:
     ```
     cd signal-react-native
     ```
   - Run the following command to install the project dependencies:
     ```
     npm install
     ```

4. Configure the app:
   - Open the project in your code editor.
   - Look for a configuration file or files that contain environment variables or settings, such as `.env` or `config.js`.
   - Set any required configuration variables based on your environment (e.g., API keys, endpoints).

5. Start the development server:
   - Run the following command to start the development server:
     ```
     npm start
     ```
   - This will launch the Metro Bundler, which serves the JavaScript bundle for your app.

6. Run the app on a device or emulator:
   - Ensure you have either an Android or iOS emulator set up, or a physical device connected to your computer.
   - Open a new terminal or command prompt window and navigate to the project directory if you're not already in it.
   - Run the following command to launch the app on the emulator or connected device:
     ```
     npx react-native run-android
     ```
     or
     ```
     npx react-native run-ios
     ```
   - This will install the app on the emulator or device and launch it.

7. Explore and modify the code:
   - Open the project in your code editor.
   - Explore the directory structure and familiarize yourself with the codebase.
   - Make any necessary modifications or enhancements to meet your requirements.

8. Test the app:
   - Use the emulator or connected device to interact with the app and test its functionality.
   - You can also use tools like React Native Testing Library or Jest to write and run tests for your app.

9. Build and deploy the app:
   - Once you are satisfied with your modifications, you can build and deploy the app.
   - Follow the documentation provided with React Native to generate the appropriate build for your target platform (Android or iOS).

10. Continuously maintain and update the app:
    - Monitor and address any reported issues or bugs.
    - Implement new features or improvements based on user feedback.
    - Keep your dependencies up to date by regularly updating them.

Please note that this guide assumes you have basic knowledge of React Native and how to work with Node.js and npm. Additionally, ensure you have reviewed any documentation or README files provided in the codebase repository to understand any specific instructions or requirements for the Signal React Native app.
